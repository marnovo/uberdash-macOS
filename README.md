# UberDash for macOS

A customizable desktop dashboard for macOS, running CoffeeScript (and eventually Javascript)-coded widgets which are rendered intermittently in HTML5 in your desktop and can take inputs from for terminal outputs from your favorite bash commands or binaries, Python scripts, and more.

## Getting started

UberDash for macOS runs on top of [Übersicht](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/felixhageloh/uebersicht)).

Download and run Übersicht, replace its `widgets` directory (check in preferences) with the one contained in this repository.

## Roadmap

More to come in terms of widgets, customizations, flexiblity, polish.
So far much of it was inspired by some bundled and modified pieces from the [Übersicht widgets repository](https://github.com/felixhageloh/uebersicht-widgets).

Interested on where this can head to? Issues and PRs welcome.
